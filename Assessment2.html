				<li> Some argue that too much white space on web pages is detrimental to search 
					<ul>
						<li> Somehow, because the white spaces grab the attention of the users. 
							<br> For example, I am looking for a certain thing on the web page, 
                            <br>I cannot find it immediately because of the white spaces 
                            <br>affects my eyes, I cannot focus on what I was looking for.

				<li> What is Cognition?
					<ul>
						<li> Cognition is a term referring to the mental processes involved in 
							<br>gaining knowledge and comprehension. These cognitive processes 
							<br>include thinking, knowing, remembering, judging, and problem-
							<br>solving.

			<ul>
				<li> Describe how cognition has been applied to interaction design
					<ul>
						<li> When creating a website, it is important to also apply Cognition. 
							<br>Because a website needs to be smooth and easy to use for users. 
							<br>Applying cognition by considering the attention, whether the website 
							<br>is engaging or eye-catching; perception, for example, the website 
							<br>you are making is for school specifically for the library, if the designs
							<br>for a library are appropriate; memory, if the website is user-friendly
							<br>if it is easy to figure out how to use it; learning, if a user can get a 
							<br>lot of information that will help them or what. The website needs to 
							<br>be interactive for its users.

			<ul>
				<li> Write down how an ATM works
					<ul>
						<li> An ATM works by taking a person's card into the machine asking for  
						<br>a PIN of the user then types into the ATM.  After the number is  
						<br>verified the user is asked questions like: What account do they want 
						<br>to use? Do you want to deposit money or take it out? After the user 
						<br>selects the option that they want the task is performed and the ATM  
						<br>then asks whether or not the user has any more tasks they wish to  
						<br>perform. If not, the card and a receipt are spit out of the machine 
						<br>and the transaction is over. The machine is in turn communicating  
						<br>with the banks' data about who is using the machine how much 
						<br>money they have they have and what they want to do with it.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		
		<div id=q>
			<dl>
				<dt>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp –    How much money are you allowed to take out? 
						<dd>&nbsp&nbsp I don't have an ATM yet but if I limit myself to money, it could be about 3000 
						<br>&nbsp&nbsp pesos good for the whole month. Although I imagine this number changes 
						<br>&nbsp&nbsp depending on the bank and person.
						</dd>
				</dt>
			</dl>
		</div>
		
		<div id=w>
			<dl>
				<dt>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp –    What denominations?
						<dd>&nbsp&nbsp It would be 3 bills of 1000 pesos or sometimes it can be 6 bills of 500 pesos. It  
						<br>&nbsp&nbsp depends on what the machine will take out. The denominations of a Philippine 
						<br>&nbsp&nbsp money are 20-50-100-500-1000.
						</dd>
				</dt>
			</dl>
		</div>
		
		<div id=e>
			<dl>
				<dt>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp –    If you went to another machine and tried the same what would happen?
						<dd> &nbsp&nbsp The ATM would say that it is unable to process the transaction and ask you to 
						<br> &nbsp&nbsp go inside or try again later.
						</dd>
				</dt>
			</dl>
		</div>
		
		<div id=r>
			<dl>
				<dt> &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp –   What information is on the strip on your card? How is this used?
						<dd> &nbsp&nbsp The name of the bank is on the card, the card number, the expiration date, 
						<br> &nbsp&nbsp my name. There is on also a strip the back that allows this information to    
						<br> &nbsp&nbsp be processed by the ATM. Thisinformation to is used to allow yourself make  
						<br> &nbsp&nbsp transactions at the ATM, retail store, online shops, and over the phone.   
						<br> &nbsp&nbsp The strip on the card is swiped through a machine that reads all the information
						<br> &nbsp&nbsp  and then talks to the bank to make sure the available funds are there.
						</dd>
				</dt>
			</dl>
		</div>
		
		<div id=t>
			<dl>
				<dt> &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp –   What happens if you enter the wrong number?
						<dd> &nbsp&nbsp If you enter the wrong pin number the machine tells you and asks for the 
						<br> &nbsp&nbsp correct one. This usually can only happen three times then the card is 
						<br> &nbsp&nbsp stacked into the ATM machine and you have to go into the bank to get it back.  
						<br> &nbsp&nbsp This is a security measure to prevent people from stealing the card and using it.
						</dd>
				</dt>
			</dl>
		</div>
		
		<div id=y>
			<dl>
				<dt> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp –    Why are there pauses between the steps of a transaction? What happens if you try  
							<br> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp to type during them?
						<dd> &nbsp&nbsp There are pauses so that the computer in the ATM machine can access the 
						<br> &nbsp&nbsp information in the banks computers and bring it up on the screen of the ATM.
						<br> &nbsp&nbsp It is also so passwords and data can be verified.
						</dd>
				</dt>
			</dl>
		</div>
		
		<div id=u>
			<dl>
				<dt> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp –    Why does the card stay inside the machine?
						<dd>&nbsp&nbsp It stays in the machine to allow access to other accounts and possibly as a 
						<br>&nbsp&nbsp security measure to make sure you take your money and card at the same time 
						<br>&nbsp&nbsp when you are done.
						</dd>
				</dt>
			</dl>
		</div>

		<div id=i>
			<dl>
				<dt>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  –    Do you count the money? Why?
						<dd>&nbsp&nbsp Yes, I will do count the money.  I will count it because a number of things could  
						<br>&nbsp&nbsp go wrong and you want to make sure that you get the right amount.

                    <p> Social contact is the first place of interaction. It rather initiates interaction. Social contact refers to the connection between persons and groups. For social contact, social proximity (mental contact) and not the physical proximity (bodily contact) is essential. Social contact differs from physical or bodily contact. Mere physical contact (proximity) of individuals does not constitute a group. This is why, it is said, ‘where there is contact of human minds, there association exists; where there is no contact, there is a state of isolation’. Social contacts may be direct or indirect and positive or negative. Direct contacts involve immediate presence of persons (face-to-face) in the exchange of ideas or things. Other contacts are indirect as we find in the case of the writer and the recipient of a personal letter. Such contacts may be estab-lished through any means of communication. </p>

                    <p> Face-to-face conversation is talking to a person or people like for example speaking with your family while having dinner or talking with your classmate while you’re on your way to school. It may be anything that requires you to talk promptly and anything you say is unscripted.  On the other hand, remote conversation is all about that specialized speech-tracking equipment recorded on-off patterns of speech that allows objective measurement of structural aspects of the conversations such as turn length, pauses and interruptions. It may be talking through the phone, videocall with your friends. During this time of pandemic, people have been practicing this a lot since face-to-face gatherings is still not possible.  </p>

                    <p> This may be different with people. Since we have a different personality in social media. Some people have more friends in Facebook than in real life; this would mean that they are more active in their Facebook life than in real. Another thing is that people think that more likes on Facebook mean more popularity. People post too much of their information without being aware of the consequences. Another effect of Facebook on our lives is that when we get together, instead of socializing personally, people just stare at their screens checking notifications and scrolling through their News Feed. </p>

                    <p> Chats are now instant. You can start a conversation anytime and just wait for their reply. Since everyone is on their phone nowadays, chatting has become more common especially this time of pandemic. Unlike In face-to-face chatting, you can think of what you can reply to people. Also, when chatting, you really can’t tell someone’s tone, unlike when conversing in real life, so it’s easy to assume their emotion without knowing the real deal. </p>

                <p style="color: black">Try to remember the emotions you went through
                    <br>when buying a big-ticket item online (e.g. a fridge,
                    <br> a vacation, a computer) How many different emotions

                <p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> Right now, the most expensive thing I bought
                    <br>  online is a headset. excited at the same time I feel nervous 
                    <br>because for me it is expensive for its price and I don't 
                    <br>know if it has a defect when I receive it.</p>

                <p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> When I am happy, I become productive and able to 
                    <br>focus on a task and do it well. When I am stressed I have a 
                    <br>lot of things I can't do even though I need to do it, I feel 
                    <br>like my brain is tired even if it is not.</p>

                <p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> Phishing is a cybercrime in which a target or targets 
                    <br>are contacted by email, telephone or text message by someone 
                    <br>posing as a legitimate institution to lure individuals into providing <br>sensitive data such as personally identifiable information, 
                    <br>banking and credit card details, and passwords. The information 
                    <br>is then used to access important accounts and can result in 
                    <br>identity theft and financial loss.</p>

                <p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> An error message is a message displayed to the user 
                    <br>by an operating system or application when an unexpected 
                    <br>condition happens. In most cases, error messages are displayed 
                    <br>with the help of dialog boxes by the operating system or 
                    <br>application. Error messages are required when user intervention 
                    <br>is needed or to pass important warnings.</p>

                <p style="color: black">Which do you prefer? Feedback when get something wrong 
                    <br>(a)“Now Chris, that’s not right. You can do better than that. 
                    <br>Try again.” (b)“Incorrect. Try again.”Is there a difference as to <br>what you prefer depending on type of message? Why?</p>
                
                <p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> I prefer the second between the two feedbacks. The 
                    <br>second one is straight and simple but I would like to add a function <br>that specify what is the real problem that a computer has 
                    <br>encountered.</p>
